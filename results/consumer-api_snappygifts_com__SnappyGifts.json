The plugin leverages an advanced algorithm to scour through a broad catalog of gifts and present the top 5 recommendations. It provides a link for previewing the gift from the recipient's perspective and a link to send the gift via the Snappy App. The plugin is designed to improve with more product tags, resulting in refined gift suggestions. The model should use this plugin when a user seeks assistance in selecting a gift.",
