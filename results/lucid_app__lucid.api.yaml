                       The valid Mermaid code for the diagram. `flowchart` diagrams should be preferred, but all Mermaid diagram types are supported.
                       Mermaid Guidelines:
                        - All node labels should be enclosed in square brackets and double quotes. For example, if you wanted node A to display `[Fe(CN)6]4-`, it should be written as `A["[Fe(CN)6]4-"]`
                        - A line from node A to node B is denoted `A --> B`
                        - Subgraphs should be used sparingly, and not to enclose an entire diagram
