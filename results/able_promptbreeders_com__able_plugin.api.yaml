  title: Able Plugin
  description: Plugin for enabling direct access to most ChatGPT store plugins without the need for installation, primarily aimed at facilitating plugin testing. When provided with a plugin name that exists in the ChatGPT store, Able retrieves plugin infos such as a brief description and plugin image/icon, together with a URL link for user to execute the plugin directly, allowing users to test the plugin without the necessity of store installation. If the provided plugin name does not match any existing plugin in the store, Able offers suggestions for plugins with names that could be queried in a second time, or alternatives to search for plugins with comparable features with another tool. In instances where a plugin exists but lacks a usable URL link, particularly if the plugin requires authentication, Able suggests alternatives for searching and utilizing plugins with similar functionalities. Able has a single path, /able, followed by the plugin name. Whenever ChatGPT is not sure user wants to use Able plugin, in particular if its prompt is too long, ChatGPT should ask confirmation before using it.
