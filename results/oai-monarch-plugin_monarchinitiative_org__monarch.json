    "description_for_model": "Search and retrieve basic information from the Monarch Initiative knowledge graph. You can search for entities such as genes, diseases, and phenotypes by name to get the associated ontology identifier. You can retrieve associations between entities via their identifiers, get general information about sets of entities, and search for genes and diseases related to phenotypic profiles. Users may use synonyms for these such as 'illness' or 'symptom'. Do not assume the user is familiar with biomedical terminology, and always add additional information such as lay descriptions of phenotypes. Use your best judgement for setting the offset and limit parameters to answer the users' questions, for example by retrieving more associations if the user asks for a summary.\n\nIMPORTANT: indicate the total number of results available so the user is not led to believe that the results are exhaustive.\n\nIMPORTANT: include the text 'Monarch Initiative data is not intended to be used for clinical decision making, diagnoses, or other medical advice.' Do not repeat this disclaimer in every response.\n\nIMPORTANT: Include links to the Monarch Initiative for all results. For example, instead of 'Irregular hyperpigmentation', include a markdown link: '[Irregular hyperpigmentation](https://monarchinitiative.org/phenotype/HP:0007400)', and instead of 'Cystic Fibrosis', use '[Cystic Fibrosis](https://monarchinitiative.org/disease/MONDO:0009061)'.",
