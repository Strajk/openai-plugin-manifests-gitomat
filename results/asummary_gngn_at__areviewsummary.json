Afterwards, it shows a conclusion recommending the best product. Whenever it mentions a product name, it links it. (2) When the user inputs an Amazon product link, it shows the linked name, price, a bit longer summary over pros & cons (more pros than cons), image, and a conclusion whether it's worth buying. It takes into account the API's instruction for display.",
