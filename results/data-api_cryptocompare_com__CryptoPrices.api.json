Real-time data may have slight latency depending on network conditions.\n- **Rate Limiting**: To maintain optimal performance and service availability, users must adhere to the rate limiting guidelines provided further down in this document. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary access restrictions.\n- **Compliance with Legal Regulations**: Users are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the use and dissemination of blockchain and digital asset data in their respective jurisdictions.\n- **Data Interpretation**: Our endpoints offer an unparalleled depth of understanding; however, users should be well-versed in blockchain and finanical markets concepts to accurately interpret and utilize the data provided.\n- **Third-Party Data Sources**: While we strive for accuracy and authenticity by complementing our data with trusted third-party sources, users should be aware that we cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of data derived from external providers.\n- **Potential Costs and Licensing**: Depending on the subscription level and usage, additional costs may apply. Be aware of any applicable licensing terms and agreements.\n- **Robust Data Integration**: Ensure that the data integration with your application is robust and resilient to changes in the underlying data structures, taking advantage of our standardized instrument mapping and unified formats.\n- **Privacy Considerations**: Be mindful of privacy regulations and best practices when utilizing personal or sensitive data in conjunction with our API, aligning your use with relevant legal and ethical standards.\n- **Availability and Redundancy**: Understand that while we strive to provide maximum uptime, unexpected outages may occur. Implement fallback mechanisms to handle such scenarios.\n\n## Authentication and Security\n\nEnsuring the secure and efficient interaction with the CCData Digital Asset API is paramount to us. We've designed our authentication methods to provide both speed and safety in every interaction.\n\n**Easy Authentication** with **Uncompromising Security**:\n\n- **Authentication Options**: Choose to pass your API key as a parameter in your query `https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/index/cc/v1/latest/tick?market=ccix&instruments=BTC-USD&api_key={YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}` or effortlessly incorporate it as an authorization header `authorization: Apikey {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}` or `authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}`.\n- **Protecting Your API Key**: Keep your API key private and avoid placing it in publicly accessible locations such as client-side code (e.g., JavaScript within a web page), public repositories on platforms like GitHub, or shared documents on cloud services. Storing the API key in a secure server environment or using environment variables is recommended to maintain confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Secure Communication**: Utilize HTTPS for all API calls to ensure encrypted communication and protect sensitive information during transmission.\n- **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**: Implement monitoring to detect any anomalous activity related to your API key or endpoints, notifying you of potentially unauthorized access. [You can monitor your use pattern here](/settings/api-keys).\n- **Revocation and Rotation**: Know the procedures for revoking and rotating API keys if there is suspicion of compromised security, ensuring continuity and integrity of service. [You have full controls to remove or add a new API keys in the api-keys user section](/settings/api-keys).\n\n## Always Available Support\n\nWhether you have queries, face challenges, or seek deeper insights, our [dedicated support team is just a click away](https://support.ccdata.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new), eager to assist and guide. \n\nOur **Enterprise plans** provide **24-hour email and Slack support** access, with direct communication links to our developers and product owners, reflecting our core belief that **'We all succeed together'**. This mantra drives every endeavor, emphasizing collective growth and collaboration as the keystones to true success in the digital asset industry—a global industry where **markets never sleep**. Even though we're based in the UK, we recognize that your journey through this ever-evolving space should not be hindered by your timezone or location. Thus, our support infrastructure at CCData is as widespread as the industry we serve, offering **24-hour support** and **on-call engineers during office hours**, with best efforts out of hours in situations of extreme urgency.\n\nWith our always-available support, we guarantee a seamless experience, reflecting the global and timeless nature of the industry we serve. **Trust us to be your steadfast companion, around the clock, around the globe**.\n\n## A Transparent Approach to Rate Limiting:\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of digital assets, we understand the importance of **simplicity and clarity**. At CCData, we've adopted an **intuitive approach** to rate limiting, focusing on **individual API calls** rather than the often **perplexing credit system**. This ensures a **straightforward experience for our users**, devoid of any ambiguities. \n\n**Each API call** you make, irrespective of its complexity or the data it retrieves, is **counted uniformly**. This approach ensures not only ease of understanding but also greater transparency in monitoring your usage. With CCData, you're always aware of your consumption, empowering you to make informed decisions without getting entangled in the intricacies of credit calculations. **Our commitment remains unwavering: to deliver an experience that's as seamless as it is transparent**.\n\nYou can readily verify your rate limit by visiting our [Rate Limit Verification Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/admin_v1_rate_limit). While this action consumes one of your rate limit calls, there's no cause for concern. All our API responses are equipped with a range of headers that offer detailed insights into your rate limiting status:\n\n- **X-Ratelimit-Limit**: Represents the maximum number of requests you are allowed to make within a specified time frame. It sets the upper boundary, ensuring users are aware of their allowed API usage capacity.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Remaining**: Provides a real-time tally of how many more requests you can make during the current rate limit window. It's an essential tool for gauging your immediate request pacing.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Remaining-All**: Gives users a comprehensive view by showing the cumulative number of requests remaining across all endpoints. It's a broader gauge, ensuring that you always have a holistic picture of your available request bandwidth.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Reset**: Informs users about when the current rate limit window will reset, clarifying when a new set of requests can commence.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Reset-All**: Conveys the universal reset time for all your rate-limited endpoints. This consolidated timer helps with overall strategic planning and resource allocation across different API functions.\n\nCollectively, these headers are designed to ensure users can transparently track, manage, and effectively optimize their API requests, eliminating unintentional rate limit overruns.\n\n## Versioning and Deprecation\n\nDocumentation is available for both the CCDATA 'Min API' and 'Data API'. You can toggle between the documentation for each of these with the drop down in the top left of the page. The Data API is CCDATA’s currently supported API platform - all endpoints have the base url [https://data-api.cryptocompare.com](https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/). \n\nThe **Data API** will **provide access** to all of the **newest products and data types**, and we **recommend** its use to all new API users.\n\nThe **Min API** gives options for both a REST and Websocket connection. The Data API currently only consists of a REST API with a websocket coming soon. \n\nPeriodically, CCData will make changes and updates to the functionality of certain endpoints, which could result in a new version of the endpoint becoming available for use. In these cases, the old version will become deprecated and replaced in the documentation by the new version. Any deprecated endpoints will continue to function as they initially did with no changes. Documentation on functionality for these deprecated endpoints will all still be available, but will be moved to the [Deprecated Section](/documentation/data-api/deprecated) of the product list.\n\n## Stand Tall with CCData\n\nAmidst the vast expanse of the financial world, let the **CCData Digital Asset API** be your beacon, illuminating the path with **clarity**, **reliability**, and **unmatched efficiency**. Dive into our comprehensive documentation, explore our diverse features, and stride forward with confidence. We're not just a service provider; we're your trusted partner in the digital asset realm. **Join us, and redefine your digital asset exploration**."

      "description": "The endpoints, parameters, or functionalities listed in this section are marked as deprecated. This means:\n- They are **no longer recommended for use** and might not be supported in future versions of our API.\n- Existing implementations that use these might continue to work, but we **can't guarantee their long-term reliability**.\n- It's **recommended to migrate** to the suggested alternatives as soon as possible to ensure compatibility and access to new features.\n\nAs our API evolves, we aim to provide more robust, efficient, and useful features. Sometimes, this means retiring older functionalities to make room for better approaches. Deprecation decisions are made based on:\n\n- **Performance Enhancements**: Newer alternatives might be faster or more resource-efficient.\n- **Feature Enhancements**: Deprecated features might lack newer capabilities.\n- **Consistency & Standards**: Aligning with modern practices or industry standards.\n- **Simplified Maintenance**: Reducing complexities that arise from supporting older functionalities.\n\n## Deprecation & Removal Process\n\nOur commitment to innovation means sometimes we need to retire old functionalities. Here's how we ensure a smooth transition:\n\n- **Announcement**: When an endpoint, parameter, or functionality is identified for deprecation, we'll mark it as such in our documentation and notify users through email and other communication channels.\n- **Support Period**: Deprecated features will still be supported for a period to allow users ample time for migration. This period will be specified but expect at least several months to a year.\n- **Removal Checks**: After the support period, we'll monitor the use of these deprecated features. As long as they are still actively used, they won't be removed.\n- **Final Notification**: If, after several checks, we find that the usage has dwindled or become non-existent, we'll send a final removal notification. Users will get another grace period, potentially up to multiple years, before the feature is fully removed.\n- **Deletion**: After the final grace period, and if no significant usage is detected, the deprecated functionality will be permanently removed from our API.\n\n## Migration Tips\n- Always check this section during API updates to ensure you're not relying on deprecated features.\n- **Plan your migration early**. Even though deprecated features remain functional now, they might be removed in the future. But don't worry we'll never remove endpoints as long as there are still being used. We'll reach out via email and other means to existing customers using deprecated endpoints and give plenty of time (multiple years) for them to switch to the new endpoints.\n- **Reach out to our support if you face any issues during migration**. We're here to help.\n\nNavigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology can be challenging, but it's an integral part of continuous improvement and innovation. The deprecation of certain functionalities in our API is a testament to our commitment to offering only the **best**, **most efficient**, and **reliable** tools for our users. We understand the potential inconveniences this might cause, and we deeply appreciate your adaptability during these changes. By staying informed and proactive, you position yourself at the forefront of the digital curve, reaping the benefits of our latest offerings. Should you **encounter any bumps along the way**, remember we're just a **call or email** away. Together, we'll shape the future of seamless digital interactions."
