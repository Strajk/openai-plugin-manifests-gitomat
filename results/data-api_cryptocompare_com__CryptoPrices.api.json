      "description": "The CCData API provides access to our industry leading digital asset data. Our REST API allows straightforward access on a request-by-request basis, and we recommend it for almost all use cases.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nOur REST API is perfect for use cases where you need to make specific requests for data, such as:\n\n* Retrieving a catalogue of the exchanges and instrument that CCData cover.\n* Retrieving historical OHLCV candlestick data for trading pairs or derivatives instruments.\n* Getting the latest reference price for a list of assets.\n* Retrieving historical order book snapshot data for a specific exchange trading pair.\n* Accessing comprehensive asset metadata and static background information on a given asset.\n\n## Versioning and Deprecation\n\nDocumentation is available for both the CCDATA ‘Min API’ and ‘Data API’. You can toggle between the documentation for each of these with the drop down in the top left of the page. The Data API is CCDATA’s currently supported API platform - all endpoints have the base url ‘[https://data-api.cryptocompare.com](https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/)/’. \n\nThe Data API will provide access to all of the newest products and data types, and we recommend its use to all new API users.\n\nThe Min API gives options for both a REST and Websocket connection. The Data API currently only consists of a REST API with a websocket coming soon. \n\nPeriodically, CCData will make changes and updates to the functionality of certain endpoints, which could result in a new version of the endpoint becoming available for use. In these cases, the old version will become deprecated and replaced in the documentation by the new version. Any deprecated endpoints will continue to function as they initially did with no changes. Documentation on functionality for these deprecated endpoints will all still be available, but will be moved to the ‘deprecated’ section of the product list.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThere are two ways to authenticate your request using your API key.\n\nFirstly, you can pass your API key as a parameter in the query string of the request, as per the following example:\n\n* `https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/index/cc/v1/latest/tick?market=ccix&instruments=BTC-USD&api_key=**YOUR_API_KEY_HERE**`\n\nAlternatively, you can add an authorisation header to the request with your API Key as the token in the following form:\n\n* `authorization: ApiKey **YOUR_API_KEY_HERE**`\n\nThe documentation for each specific endpoint shows examples of both methods and how to use them with Curl, Python or Javascript.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nRate limiting across the CCDATA API’s depends on your subscription level. Calls made without any API key authentication will face much harsher rate limiting than those made using a valid API key, even one linked to a free account.\n\nYou can check the remaining limits for a specific API key by adding they key (as detailed in the ‘Authetication’ section) to the following rate limit endpoint, appearing under ‘Utilities’ in the documentation - [https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/admin/v1/rate/limit](https://data-api.cryptocompare.com/admin/v1/rate/limit) \n\nYou can also check your usage and rate limits on the following page - after signing in to your account - [Follow the link to check API rate limits and your remaining API calls](https://www.cryptocompare.com/cryptopian/api-keys)\n\n## Responses\n\nAll responses will be given in JSON format by default - although some endpoints do allow a CSV response format using the ‘response_format’ parameter.\n\nAll timestamps, both in request parameters and responses, are given in Unix epoch format in UTC.\n\nMore detail on exact response format is given in the documentation for each individual endpoint. \n\n## Errors\n\nAll API responses give an ‘Err’ response field. In successful responses this will be blank, but in error responses this will give more details.\n\nResponse status codes are also given to aid with finding and solving response or request errors.\n\nMore detail on error codes is found in the documentation for each individual endpoint\n\n## API Status\n\nCurrent API status information as well as uptime stats, previous status updates and system latency metrics can be found at:\n\n[https://status.cryptocompare.com/](https://status.cryptocompare.com/)\n\n## Contact Us and Support\n\nIf you run into problems with your account or rate limits, have questions about the API or something is unclear, please contact our support team using the following link - [https://support.ccdata.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new](https://support.ccdata.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new)"

      "description": "The endpoints, parameters, or functionalities listed in this section are marked as deprecated. This means:\n* They are **no longer recommended for use** and might not be supported in future versions of our API.\n* Existing implementations that use these might continue to work, but we **can't guarantee their long-term reliability**.\n* It's **recommended to migrate** to the suggested alternatives as soon as possible to ensure compatibility and access to new features.\n\nAs our API evolves, we aim to provide more robust, efficient, and useful features. Sometimes, this means retiring older functionalities to make room for better approaches. Deprecation decisions are made based on:\n\n* **Performance Enhancements**: Newer alternatives might be faster or more resource-efficient.\n* **Feature Enhancements**: Deprecated features might lack newer capabilities.\n* **Consistency & Standards**: Aligning with modern practices or industry standards.\n* **Simplified Maintenance**: Reducing complexities that arise from supporting older functionalities.\n\n## Deprecation & Removal Process\n\nOur commitment to innovation means sometimes we need to retire old functionalities. Here's how we ensure a smooth transition:\n\n* **Announcement**: When an endpoint, parameter, or functionality is identified for deprecation, we'll mark it as such in our documentation and notify users through email and other communication channels.\n* **Support Period**: Deprecated features will still be supported for a period to allow users ample time for migration. This period will be specified but expect at least several months to a year.\n* **Removal Checks**: After the support period, we'll monitor the use of these deprecated features. As long as they are still actively used, they won't be removed.\n* **Final Notification**: If, after several checks, we find that the usage has dwindled or become non-existent, we'll send a final removal notification. Users will get another grace period, potentially up to multiple years, before the feature is fully removed.\n* **Deletion**: After the final grace period, and if no significant usage is detected, the deprecated functionality will be permanently removed from our API.\n\n### Migration Tips\n* Always check this section during API updates to ensure you're not relying on deprecated features.\n* **Plan your migration early**. Even though deprecated features remain functional now, they might be removed in the future. But don't worry we'll never remove endpoints as long as there are still being used. We'll reach out via email and other means to existing customers using deprecated endpoints and give plenty of time (multiple years) for them to switch to the new endpoints.\n* **Reach out to our support if you face any issues during migration**. We're here to help.\n\nNavigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology can be challenging, but it's an integral part of continuous improvement and innovation. The deprecation of certain functionalities in our API is a testament to our commitment to offering only the best, most efficient, and reliable tools for our users. We understand the potential inconveniences this might cause, and we deeply appreciate your adaptability during these changes. By staying informed and proactive, you position yourself at the forefront of the digital curve, reaping the benefits of our latest offerings. Should you encounter any bumps along the way, remember we're just a call or email away. Together, we'll shape the future of seamless digital interactions."
