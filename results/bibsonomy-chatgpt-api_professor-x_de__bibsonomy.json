    "description_for_model": "The Bibsonomy ChatGPT plugin serves as an intermediary for interaction between the publication management system, Bibsonomy, and ChatGPT. It provides the ability to search for, connect, add, and edit publications on Bibsonomy with specific filters. It also offers rudimentary support for Bookmarks, which is scheduled for future enhancement. The plugin emphasizes the importance of tags in publication management, with the recommendation of using 2-5 pertinent tags per publication. It is crucial that these tags align with or be identical to those previously used by the user. Therefore, it's recommended to procure user data and tags prior to adding a publication. It's important to note that adding and editing publications impacts the Bibsonomy service directly. As such, data should be presented to the user in a structured format for approval before executing POST commands. Given Bibsonomy's role as a scientific database, it's vital that all data should be accurate and not artificially generated by Language Learning Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The data can be sourced through this plugin, user input, or other plugins designed for scientific publication search. The most essential data elements are the \"resource hashes\" or \"inter/intra hashes\", which are critical for uniquely identifying posts. It's strictly forbidden for ChatGPT to generate these hashes. They should be provided by the plugin and must be utilized EXACTLY as given, taking into account case sensitivity. Since the database of Bibsonomy only contains papers/publications already posted by other users, its database is far from complete. Due to this, the semantic scholar search endpoint should be used whenever possible (either in combination with the bibsonomy endpoint or on its own). Only if its obvious from the conversation, that the search should be performed on bibsonomy, the bibsonomy endpoint should be used.",
