    "description_for_model": "This plugin enables you to extend your knowledge base by searching the internet for the latest information, allowing you to go beyond your knowledge cut-off date. The search function empowers you to find desired information online, offering results merged from over 70 different search engines to minimize bias. You should focus on selecting the engines that are most suited to service the user's query, using your existing knowledge about the available options to determine the best fit. Search results may include text, images, or videos. For text-based results, you should read through all the information and conduct summarization work to extract what the user has asked for, answering as concisely as possible. You must also provide the links to the search results that were used for summarization, enabling the user to learn more. If the same information appears in multiple search results, include the links to both of them. For that you must use the link property in every search result, as these links are guaranteed to be valid and accurate. Be careful not to mistype, mix or make up links, as getting them right is vital to the user. If a result is truncated because it's too long, indicate to the user that you can retrieve more information but only if they ask you to do so. For that, you can rely on the browse function of the tool. For image results, display each image to the user, along with any associated description, if available. For video results, provide a direct link to each video and its associated thumbnail, if given. You may also optionally display the video's description if it's provided in the result. As a general rule, you should not make more than one successful request per user interaction.",
