            description: The input necessary for the recommendation API. In the case where a user has made a previous request during the same session, the system should ensure that the data in the current request is relevant to the ongoing stage of the conversation, while containing all essential information. Repeating data from previous requests is acceptable only if it is still pertinent to the current conversation stage, otherwise, it should be avoided to ensure accurate recommendations.
            properties:
                user_query:
                    type: string
                    description: >
                            A detailed, dialogue-style expression of the user's CURRENT shopping intentions or inquiries. This should encompass specifics about the type of product they're interested in, their style preferences, any particular occasion or purpose for the item, and any other relevant information that could assist in tailoring product recommendations to their unique needs and tastes.
                            If this is a subsequent request in a session, the user_query should be a more specific description of what the user is currently looking for. It should include all relevant information about the user that you know so far.
                            Do not copy the user's message verbatim, instead rewrite it in a clear and concise way. Make sure to use completely a new user_query for subsequent queries with all new relevant details.
                keywords:
                    type: string
                    description: >
                            Given the user_query, generate a comma separated list of 20 keywords that are directly related and answer the fashion request or question.
                            These keywords should be based on factors such as event type, gender, color trends, matching colors, style, season, fit, fabric type, brand similarity, budget, body type, styling, popularity, sizing, availability, brand ownership, layering, celebrity style, event themes, and any other relevant factors.

                            - DO use some synonyms
                            - DO NOT include any items that the user specifically mentions owning.
                            - DO NOT include categories that the user specifically mentions owning.
                            - DO only use keywords, not sentences.
                            - DO be specific focus on the distinct attributes, elements, or properties of the item or concept instead of using generic or blanket terms:
                                Avoid using broad categories, themes, celebrity names or events by converting them into more specific keywords that highlight their unique characteristics or features.
                                Examples:
                                    - For themes, use attributes instead of the theme itself, e.g., "floral print" for a Hawaiian theme. Do not use "Hawaiian"
                                    - For events, use clothing attributes specific to the event, e.g., "tailored suits" for weddings. Do not use "weddings".
                                    - For celebrity styles, focus on aspects like "boho chic," rather than the celebrity's name.
                                    - For popular styles, use specific keywords like "bike shorts," not generic terms like "trendy."
                                    - For fabric types, emphasize unique properties, e.g., "cotton.", not "breathable"
                                    - For brand similarity, focus on distinct styles or design elements, e.g., "bold patterns.", not the brand name.
                                    - For color coordination, emphasize complementary or contrasting shades, e.g., "navy and white" or "red and green pairings." not "complementary colors"
                                    - For mixing patterns, detail specific pattern combinations, e.g., "stripes with florals" or "polka dots and plaid."
                                    - Instead of using "sustainable fashion brands" as a keyword, focus on the sustainable materials or practices, e.g., "organic cotton blouses," "Tencel wrap dresses," or "ethically-produced shoes."

                            Examples:
