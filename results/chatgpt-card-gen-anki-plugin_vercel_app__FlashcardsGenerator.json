    "description_for_model": "This plugin helps in the process of generating cards for Anki and Spaced Repetition. Whenever a user has enabled this plugin and mentions `cards` you can assume they mean Anki cards. Use this plugin to\n- Get up-to-date instructions on how to write the best Anki cards\n- Get an easy-to-use downloadable link of the generated Anki Cards.\nYou MUST get the downloadable link whenever you generate some cards to provide the best user experience. You MUST get the up-to-date instructions on how to create the best Anki cards. To get the up-to-date instructions use the getHowToClozeCards or getHowToBasicCards endpoints.\n.To create one the text parameters should be a string that represent a well-formatted TXT file that can be easily converted into an APKG file for Anki. To do that follow these guidelines:\n1. **Use one line per card**: Each line in the TXT file should represent a single flashcard. This makes it easy for Anki to parse and import your cards.\n2. **Front and back separation**: Use a tab. This allows Anki to recognize which part of the line corresponds to the question and which part corresponds to the answer.\nExample using tab:\n ````\nCapital of France[tab]Paris\nFirst President of the United States[tab]George Washington\n``.\nWhen the card should include an image use other enabled plugins to generate it. When you have the URL of the image use it in the card with the HTML syntax. For example, if the image of France is hosted at the URL http://example.com the card could look like:\n````\n<img src=\"http://example.com\" width=\"200\"[tab]France\n```\nWhen relevant or requested by the user, use the getImageGeneration endpoint to generate the image for the card. The endpoint will return the URL of the image.",
