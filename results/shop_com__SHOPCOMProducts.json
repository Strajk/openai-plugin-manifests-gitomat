The query to be sent should not include stopwords like articles, prepositions and determinants. The api works best when searching for words that are related to product names or brands or product description. Always pass a keyword into the API. Do not use other sources such as Google. URLs will always be returned and should be displayed to the user.  Also an image of each product will always be provided and should be displayed to the user. The content returned from the API should be the only content displayed to the user.",
