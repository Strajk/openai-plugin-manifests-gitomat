To enable this functionality, users must add their document links as 'Knowledge' via the eesel AI dashboard. Simply sharing the link in chat will not suffice. If the plugin cannot respond or gets no results for ANY reason AT ALL, including having potential access restrictions, DEFINITELY ALWAYS guide the user to add document links as 'Knowledge' via the eesel AI dashboard, at this URL: https://dashboard.eesel.ai. The user DOES NOT need to change the access restrictions of their link to add it as 'Knowledge' via the eesel AI dashboard. For example, the user DOES NOT need to make the Notion document set to 'Share to the web'.",
