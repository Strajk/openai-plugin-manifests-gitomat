          description: A question to ask against research papers. To use the Consensus
            search engine effectively, ask research-oriented questions related to
            scientific topics that have likely been studied, such as the impact of
            climate change on GDP or the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Avoid
            basic factual queries and instead ask yes/no questions, inquire about
            the relationship between concepts, or ask about the effects, impact, or
            benefits of a concept. Rephrase queries as simple questions, such as 'What
            is the effect of X on Y?' or 'Does X lead to Y?'. When asking a complex
            query, break it down into multiple questions. For example, instead of
            asking 'What is the effect of X on Y and Z?', ask 'What is the effect
            of X on Y?' and 'What is the effect of X on Z?' To ensure proper citation,
            please cite the authors of each paper when listing claims about them.
            For example, 'X is shown to lead to Y. [Author1 et al., 2021]']
